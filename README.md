## About Me
I am a passionate data analytics student currently enrolled in Turing College. I'm passionate about dissecting information, making data-driven decisions, and honing my technical skills daily. Beyond analytics, I thrive in collaborative environments, drawing from experiences in international projects and the vibrant community at Turing College. Outside of data, I'm an avid traveler and sports enthusiast, constantly seeking new adventures and challenges. While I may not have many coding projects yet, I am actively learning and applying my skills  in data analysis and Python programming.

## Project Highlights
- **Finance Dataset Analysis**: Last year, I completed an analysis project on financial data as part of my coursework at Analytica Camp. This project showcased my skills in data analysis using Python. As I continue my studies at Turing College, I am expanding my knowledge in data analysis and Python programming, focusing on similar datasets and refining my analytical techniques.
